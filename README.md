# Frontend for Vulnerability Alert & Reporting Tool

This folder contains the frontend (HTML, CSS, JS) for the Vulnerability Monitor system.

## How to Run

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Make sure the backend API is running and accessible (default: http://localhost:5000).
3. Enter your email and websites, then click "Start Monitoring".

## How it Works
- The frontend sends a POST request to the backend API `/api/scan` and displays the results.

## Contents
- `index.html` and any static assets.
